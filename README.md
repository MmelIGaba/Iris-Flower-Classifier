?? Notes
This project is for portfolio purposes only. No license is applied, and reuse is not permitted.# Iris-Flower-Classifier
Classify iris flowers into Setosa, Versicolor, or Virginica using supervised learning. This beginner ML project uses the labeled Iris dataset, explores features, trains models like Logistic Regression or KNN, and evaluates performance with accuracy and confusion matrix. Ideal for foundational ML practice.
